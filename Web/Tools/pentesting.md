# Pentesting

- Scan web server for known vulnerabilities:
```
nikto -h URL
```

- Looking for existing and or hidden web objects:
```
dirb URL
```

- Analyze a viewable traffic on a given network interface:
```
tcpdump
```

#### [dirhunt](https://github.com/Nekmo/dirhunt): Web directory listing
Unlike dirb, dirhunt searching is not via dictionary but a crawler. It analyzes each webpage to search all paths via 
links. Check the [documentation](http://docs.nekmo.org/dirhunt/usage.html) for futher informations.
